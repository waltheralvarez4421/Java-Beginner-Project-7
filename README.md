# Java-Beginner-Project-7
Beginner project completed during my Master's program. 
This is a program prompts the user 
for an input and output file 
that reads each line in a file, 
reverses its lines, and writes them to another file. 
For example, if the file input.txt contains the lines 
Mary had a little lamb 
Its fleece was white as snow 
And everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go. 
and you run 
reverse input.txt output.txt 
then output.txt contains 
The lamb was sure to go. 
And everywhere that Mary went 
Its fleece was white as snow 
Mary had a little lamb
